## 📄 `send_tx_with_attestations.js`

This example demonstrates how to send a real transaction to the Pod Network using [Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) and fetch validator attestations from the Pod-specific `pod_metadata` field in the transaction receipt.

### ✅ Features

- Uses environment variables (`.env`) to manage sensitive data
- Sends EIP-1559 style transactions
- Retrieves and prints validator attestations from the receipt
- Based on Pod Network's blockless consensus design

---

### 🛠 Requirements

- Node.js v18+
- NPM

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 📦 .env Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the same folder with the following variables:

```dotenv
RPC_URL=https://rpc.v2.pod.network
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
TO_ADDRESS=0xRECEIVER_ADDRESS_HERE
```

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file** – always add it to `.gitignore`.

---

### 🚀 Run the script

```bash
node send_tx_with_attestations.js
```

If successful, you'll see:

### 📚 How it works

- Sends a small amount of pETH to the recipient using EIP-1559
- Waits for confirmation
- Makes a second RPC call to `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to retrieve Pod-specific metadata
- Displays each validator’s signature (attestation)
