# Enshrining Rollup-Boost with censorship-resistant auctions on pod.

<img width="1012" height="512" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-22 at 2 55 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db2f3ab9-0dbf-40a7-a922-53c35625b71f" />

L2 sequencers order transactions as they arrive, which leads to
[spamming by searchers](https://writings.flashbots.net/mev-and-the-limits-of-scaling) trying to capture MEV (Miner
Extractable Value). This spamming wastes the L2 throughput and makes it slower and expensive for normal users.
Rollup-Boost addresses this issue by auctioning the transaction ordering based on priority fees. This not only fixes the
spam problem but also the protocol to
[capture MEV revenue internally](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/06/priority-is-all-you-need) instead of leaking it
completely to external searchers.

The priority auction takes place within an external builder service that operates inside a Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE). The TEE ensures the
[privacy of the bids and guarantees correct ordering](https://writings.flashbots.net/introducing-rollup-boost) based on
priority fees. However, the external builder has the power to censor bids, rigging the auction results completely.

pod enshrines the Rollup-Boost stack by providing censorship resistance for the priority auctions. Transactions are
streamed to a network of nodes, and the TEE builder verifies a certificate issued by the network that guarantees the bid
set is complete. The protocol ensures that an adversary needs to control at least 1/3 of the nodes to be able to censor
transactions.

Below is a proof of concept implementation to test the integration of Rollup-Boost with pod for conducting
censorship-resistant, verifiable priority auctions. For motivation and further explanation, see:
https://www.notion.so/pod-network/L2-transaction-auction-on-pod-21ea9700b29b808caa0feb5330324b81.

### Requirements:

- go v1.24+
- rust
- docker
- foundry

To run the example, we need to setup a local development network consisting of L1 and L2 networks and make sure the
auction contract is deployed on pod.

### Running local OP stack devnet

We will use the [builder playground](https://github.com/flashbots/builder-playground) to run the OP stack network
locally.

Install the builder playground with:

```bash
go install github.com/flashbots/builder-playground@870e880ed3fa4624e0f42bdc59b8078c7b550e8b
```

Then, run the builder playground with:

```bash
builder-playground cook opstack --external-builder http://host.docker.internal:4444
```

> [!NOTE] If you get an error
> `Error: unlinkat <HOME>/.playground/devnet/data_validator/validators/logs/validator.log: permission denied`, remove
> the .playground directory: `sudo rm -rf ~/.playground`

We also need to run a custom block builder that will fetch transactions from a pod auction and include them in block,
sorting by the _max priority fee_. Clone the repository and run the builder with:

### Prefunding accounts

For the purpose of demonstation, the CLI has hardcoded few private keys that need to be prefunded. The same accounts
will be used on pod to pay gas for bidding on the auction contract. In case the accounts lack funds, they can be
prefunded with prefund.sh script. To do this, we need an account on pod with some funds. An account can be funded from
devnet faucet on https://faucet.dev.pod.network. Then, run the script with:

```bash
POD_PRIVATE_KEY=<PRIVATE KEY OF A FUNDED ACCOUNT ON POD> POD_RPC_URL=wss://rpc.v2.pod.network ./prefund.sh
```

### Running OP Builder

To run the OP builder, we need to clone the `op-rbuilder` repository and run it with the appropriate parameters.

```bash
git clone -b pod-builder git@github.com:podnetwork/op-rbuilder.git
```

Then, enter the `op-rbuilder` directory and run the builder:

```bash
RUST_LOG="info,client=debug" cargo run -p op-rbuilder --bin op-rbuilder -- node \
                                    --pod.enabled \
                                    --chain $HOME/.playground/devnet/l2-genesis.json \
                                    --http --http.port 2222 \
                                    --authrpc.addr 0.0.0.0 --authrpc.port 4444 --authrpc.jwtsecret $HOME/.playground/devnet/jwtsecret \
                                    --port 30333 --disable-discovery \
                                    --metrics 127.0.0.1:9011 \
                                    --rollup.builder-secret-key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
                                    --trusted-peers enode://79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798483ada7726a3c4655da4fbfc0e1108a8fd17b448a68554199c47d08ffb10d4b8@127.0.0.1:30304
```

> [!NOTE] If you get an error `Error: genesis hash in the storage does not match the specified chainspec`, remove the
> reth directory: `rm ~/.local/share/reth/ -r`

## Bidding L2 transactions on pod auction

To bid the layer 2 transactions on a pod auction, we will use the [CLI](./src/bin/send_tx.rs).

### Bidding batch of transactions

To bid transactions for all the keys for a certain block with random max priority fee, run:

```bash
cargo run -- bid-batch --amount 500
```

You should see output similar to:
