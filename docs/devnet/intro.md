# Devnet 
The pod devnet is a test network for developers to experiment 
with the pod network. It is designed to be a sandbox for testing 
and development purposes, allowing developers to build and test 
their applications without the need for real assets or transactions.


> We expect the devnet to have breaking changes or be reset (pruned completely) at any time.
