# Reference SDK

Rust library for interacting with pod.

## Overview

The pod Rust SDK provides a robust interface for interacting with the pod network through its [JSON-RPC API](/reference/rpc-api). This SDK enables developers to communicate with pod nodes, manage transactions, and handle network responses in a type-safe manner. The SDK includes comprehensive error handling, serialization management, and strongly-typed responses for pod-specific features.
