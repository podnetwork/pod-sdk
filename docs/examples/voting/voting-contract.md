## Voting Contract

### Core concepts

#### Voter state

```solidity
enum VoterState { Unregistered, Registered, Voted }
```

- **Unregistered**: Not authorized to vote.
- **Registered**: Authorized but has not yet voted.
- **Voted**: Already cast a vote and cannot vote again.

#### Poll structure

```solidity
struct Poll {
    uint256 deadline;
    uint256 maxChoice;
    address owner;
    mapping(address => VoterState) voters;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) voteCount;
    uint256 totalVotes;
    uint256 totalVoters;
    uint256 winningChoice;
}
```

A Poll includes:

- A deadline, choice count, and owner.
- A voter registry and vote tally.
- The selected winner, which can only be set post-deadline.

#### Poll ID

Polls are uniquely identified by their IDs, which are derived from the input arguments used to create them. ID is used in all
contract functions to refer to a particular poll.

```solidity
bytes32 pollId = keccak256(abi.encode(
    deadline,
    maxChoice,
    owner,
    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(voters))
));

```

### Smart contract interface

#### State

The contract has **no** publicly accessible state. Instead, it exposes a method to query the state of a poll.

#### Events

- `PollCreated(bytes32 pollId, uint256 deadline)`
- `Voted(bytes32 pollId, address voter, uint256 choice)`
- `Winner(bytes32 pollId, uint256 choice)`

These events allow external systems (e.g. client applications) to subscribe and respond to on-chain activity in
real-time. For example, an application can obtain the ID of the poll created by the transaction by reading the
`PollCreated` event in its receipt.

#### Functions

##### createPoll

```solidity
function createPoll(uint256 deadline, uint256 maxChoice, address[] calldata voters) public returns (bytes32)
```

Used to create a new poll.

- Validations:
  - The poll ID is unique.
  - The deadline is in the future.
  - There is at least one voter and one choice.
- Emits `PollCreated`, which contains the poll ID.

##### vote

```solidity
function vote(bytes32 pollId, uint256 choice) public
```

- Validations:
  - The poll must exist and be open (with the deadline not yet passed).
  - The sender must be a registered voter who hasn't yet voted.
  - The choice must be valid (1 through maxChoice).

- Updates voter state and tallies the vote.
- Emits `Voted(pollId, voter, choice)`.

##### setWinningChoice

```solidity
function setWinningChoice(bytes32 pollId, uint256 choice) public
```

- Validations:
  - The deadline must have passed.
  - The winning choice hasnâ€™t already been set.
  - The choice is the definitive winner.
- Emits `Winner(pollId, choice)`.

Note that it is not required that all participants have already cast their votes. This is intentional to prevent a dishonest voter
from blocking the poll. The contract assesses if the selected choice is definitely the winner, no matter if more votes
come in for another candidate.

##### getVotes

```solidity
function getVotes(bytes32 pollId) public view returns (uint participants, uint[] memory votes)
```

It's a helper function that applications can call to gain insight into the poll state and calculate the winner.
