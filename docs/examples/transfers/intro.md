# Transfers

One of the key applications that can take advantage of Pod’s lightning-fast nature is processing payment transactions.

This guide demonstrates how to make payments on the POD Network using the Pod Rust SDK. We’ll cover the entire process, from checking balances to sending transactions and monitoring their status.

For sending and receiving payments with an ethereum-compatible wallet, see [Getting Started](/getting-started).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An account with funds on the pod devnet network, or use the [faucet](https://faucet.dev.pod.network/).
- pod Rust SDK installed.
