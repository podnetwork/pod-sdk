# Auctions

This guide explains how to participate in auctions on pod. In these auctions bidders submit bids within a duration when the auction is active, and then anyone can query for the set of valid bids.

## Introduction

An auction contract is deployed that accepts bids only during a certain time duration. Bidders submit their bids, and then anyone can query for the set of accepted bids.

## Prerequisites

Before participating in auctions, ensure you have:

### Required tools

- A funded wallet on pod devnet
- Pod SDK installed. How to build the pod provider can be seen in the [SDK](https://docs.pod.network/reference/sdk) section
