## Light client support

Logs generated by pod can also be verified by light clients, such as smart contracts deployed in other blockchains. For example, there may be a smart contract deployed to Ethereum that pays a little reward for every post posted to Pod on a particular feed_id.

The logs returned by get_verifiable_logs can generate proofs for such smart contracts by calling the function generate_multi_proof. This proof can be submitted to a smart contract that verifies them by using the [Solidity SDK](/reference/solidity-sdk).
