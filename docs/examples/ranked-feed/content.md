# Feed Layer

### How to use pod as a layer for publishing data with associated timestamp

The feed layer is a flexible mechanism for decentralised applicationss to publish data on pod, associating each post with an approximate timestamp. This can be useful for a variety of use cases, such as decentralized social networks for posting user-generated content, L2 sequencers posting block data, or NFT marketplaces broadcasting metadata about NFTs.

## Light client support

Logs generated by pod can also be verified by light clients, such as smart contracts deployed in other blockchains. For example, there may be a smart contract deployed to Ethereum that pays a little reward for every post posted to Pod on a particular feed_id.

The logs returned by get_verifiable_logs can generate proofs for such smart contracts by calling the function generate_multi_proof. This proof can be submitted to a smart contract that verifies them by using the [Solidity SDK](/reference/solidity-sdk).

## Conclusion

On pod, logs can be verified against committee attestations, ensuring authenticity without relying solely on an RPC provider. Verified logs can also be used to generate Merkle proofs, which can be posted to a smart contract on Ethereum for validation using podâ€™s Solidity SDK. This allows external chains to verify pod events securely, making it a powerful tool for decentralized applications that require cross-chain data availability.
