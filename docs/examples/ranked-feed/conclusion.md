## Conclusion

On pod, logs can be verified against committee attestations, ensuring authenticity without relying solely on an RPC provider. Verified logs can also be used to generate Merkle proofs, which can be posted to a smart contract on Ethereum for validation using podâ€™s Solidity SDK. This allows external chains to verify pod events securely, making it a powerful tool for decentralized applications that require cross-chain data availability.
