! snippet batch_auction_description 
A demonstration of how pod can be used to build a fast, decentralised  
limit-order protocol that settles on Ethereum. This can be leveraged  
by protocols such as CowSwap, UniswapX, etc.   
! snippet end

! snippet did_plc_description
A demonstration of how pod can be used to build a decentralised identity   
registry that is compatible with the W3C Decentralised Identifier (DID)  
and allows for key rotation. Such a registry can be used by decentralised  
social networks, such as Bluesky, to allow users to resolve identities and keys.
