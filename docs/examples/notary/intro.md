# ðŸ“œ Notary

This guide explains how you could implement a Notary contract on pod.

The Notary smart contract provides a timestamping service for documents. By submitting a document hash and an associated
timestamp, users can create an immutable record that attests to the document's existence at or before a certain time.
Importantly, this mechanism proves the age of a document but does not make any assertions about its _ownership_ or
_authorship_.
