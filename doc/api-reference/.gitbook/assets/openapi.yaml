      Orderbook Data (`ob_`) is a read-focused API surface that provides access
      to

      markets and orderbook activity without requiring clients to run their own

      indexer or interact with the orderbook contracts directly. It is powered

      by a native indexer built into the Pod protocol, ensuring fast,
      consistent,

      and up-to-date views of on-chain state.


      The API exposes live orderbook snapshots, historical OHLCV candles,

      account-level order history and positions, making it ideal for trading

      interfaces, analytics, and monitoring services.


      📝 This is a JSON-RPC 2.0 API. The request path is not important; the

      method to execute is defined by the method field in the request body. You

      can send all requests to /, and any path after / is optional and used only

      for documentation clarity.

    description: |
      Ethereum Interface (`eth_`) provides an Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC layer
      that allows existing wallets, tools, and libraries to interact with Pod
      using familiar methods and conventions. It is designed to be drop-in
      compatible with standard Ethereum client workflows, allowing developers to
      use common tooling such as `ethers.js`, `alloy.rs`, and `cast` without
      modification.

      The interface covers the transaction submission and receipt lifecycle,
      including balance and nonce discovery, read-only contract calls, log
      queries, and real-time subscriptions.

        Positions track the cost basis of acquired tokens (from buys and

        unrealized PnL using the current clearing price. The response includes

        **Note:** This returns the wallet balance, which is distinct from the
        orderbook contract balance.

        To query the balance deposited in the orderbook contract, call the
        `getBalance` function on the orderbook contract.


        The `block_number` parameter is accepted for Ethereum compatibility but
        is ignored.

        **Pod-specific behavior:** If the transaction already specifies a gas

        Otherwise, returns `21000` (standard transaction gas).

        Creates a subscription to receive real-time updates over WebSocket.

        **Pod-specific subscriptions:**
        - `pod_orderbook` - Receive orderbook snapshots on each mutation
        - `pod_orders` - Receive order updates for specified orderbooks

        Subscriptions follow the standard Ethereum `eth_subscribe` pattern:
        1. Subscribe with `eth_subscribe` → receive subscription ID
        2. Receive updates via `eth_subscription` notifications
        3. Cancel with `eth_unsubscribe`
